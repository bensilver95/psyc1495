# Research Methods: Data Science, Justice, and Social Change
This repository holds all of the coding tutorials and homework assignments for a course I taught at Columbia in Fall 2025. You can find the syllabus for the course [here](https://psyc1495.netlify.app/).

Each week, students completed an in-class tutorial and a homework assignment. Each week's folder in this repository contains the in-class tutorial (with and without code), the homework assignment (without code), and any required datasets.
